# CS499 Capstone ePortfolio

Within this capstone, each student was tasked with taking and enhancing past class assignments and creating a new capstone project that beautifully demonstrates our knowledge and progress throughout our learning journey at Southern New Hampshire State University.

## Self-Assessment

Throughout my different classes I have learned my software developing skills. From the beginning, my very first class learning Python was so hard at the time due to it being my first time ever learning to code. I remember taking another class and learning Java thinking that Java was so easy in comparison. I took until I learned C++ later that I realized, Python only seemed hard because it was my first time learning any computer language. Once I had all three down, I had a passion grow for wanting to learn more. 

Many of the concepts seemed hard at first. My first 'this' pointer confused me quite a bit and I had great struggle with learning how to embed two different languages. Five years later I after juggling my working and school assignments, here I am completing my capstone. I was terrified of this capstone. Every class had a base guide of what the class was looking for in the assignments. This time I was on my own. 

For this capstone I had to take knowledge from past classes and use this to enhance a project previously created. I love making applications and websites. I love seeing the smaller pieces of a system slowly together on my screen. 
 

I selected my **CS360 software applications** project. I struggled in this class and was determind to select this because I struggled.  This project was made up of an inventory application with a log in screen, an inventory screen, an SQLite Database, and quantity CRUD elements for the user. 

What I made is a recipe application with a single screen that is made up of fragmented pages, a bottom navigation bar, an active search bar, sorted categorized pages, a dark mode theme version, and an SQLite database. 
- For the *software development enhancement*, I wanted to create an application from the beginning, add a navigation element, and lastly add a dark mode theme. These are all elements that show understanding of the application as a whole system to navigate through and also what a user would interact with. I want to push elements that would help users.
- For *algorithms and data structures*, I added an active search bar. This search bar looks for the user's input and uses the words to look for match words or letter within the items from this data filtering.
- For *databases*, I have added sorting data pages. These pages would only display specific meal categories such as breakfast or lunch.


I wanted to have a similar inventory like storage to mimic the first artifact but with elements that a front-end developer would work on. I love the user interactive building side of my classes. I especially love my **CS365 Full Stack** class. Where I made a Single Page Application for the Admin side of a website. 

These skills used to create this application along with my full stack display understanding and growth within the field of developing for future clients in mind. I look forward to working with any future team to create the perfect system with user-friendly elements for all clients.

Thank you so much for your time and have a wonderful day!
